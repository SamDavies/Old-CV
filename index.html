        Thing - Photo Sharing Social Network
    </h3>

    <img src="images/owlLogo1.png" alt="Thing Logo" height="150px" class="project-image rcorners">
    <p>Founder and creator of the social network Thing, available on the iOS app store. Users can create events (things)
        and share images. </p>

    <p>Thing helps you find the best student events and night clubs with the potential to expand beyond the student
        target market. It is currently available on the
        <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/thing-student-network/id1030857942?mt=8">iOS App Store</a>.</p>

    <p>For my 4th year honours project, I implemented a newsfeed ordering algorithm inspired by Facebook’s EdgeRank and
        a recommender engine to predict future ‘Things’ using Spark. In the same way that Netflix recommends movies,
        Thing is able to learn what Things a user likes and push these to the top of their newsfeed.</p>

        ORBIT - Factset Online Report Builder Interface
    </h3>
    <p>My internship at Factset in London was to design a web interface in Angular JS, allowing non technical product
        developers to generate data reports. This replaced many steps in the development of all reports at Factset by
        highly automating the process. I also pioneered behaviour driven development in the company, providing a
        presentation and tutoring the engineers. They have since offered me a full time position as a Software
        Engineer.</p>

    <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/">Project Website</a>
    <p>The aim of the project was to train multi-layer neural network classifiers and convolutional network classifiers
        to classify handwritten digits using the well- known MNIST dataset and Numpy. This was then written up as an
        iPython notebook.</p>

        SmartLock
    </h3>
    <p>A team project to design and implement a smart door lock for the IoT. The door can be remotely locked and
        unlocked via the smart phone apps, whilst still allowing the use of a physical key. You can enable your friends
        to lock and unlock your Smart Locks, all controlled through apps for iOS, Android and Web. Machine learning
        techniques are being used to classify malicious entries.</p>

        Autonomous Robot Football
    </h3>
    <p>I led a team of 7, creating robots which played foosball autonomously against opposition robots using a planner
        and vision system connected to an overhead camera. The final tournament was attended by industry experts from
        Google, Amazon, IBM and Accenture.</p>

                aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

    <p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to
        create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple,
        blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to
        copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

            class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting
        <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris
        Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a
                href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a
                href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
