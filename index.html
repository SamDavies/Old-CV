    <p>
        <b>
            Unibuddy GraphQL API
        </b> -
        I lead development of Unibuddy’s GraphQL API and event driven micro-service architecture.
        The micro-services communicate using kafka and deploy continuously using Circle CI.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Kafka Streaming Analytics
        </b> -
        I lead development on a real time steaming analytics system using an event based
        architecture. The system was used to track click streams on the Unibuddy platform.
        The
        system is massively scalable using kafka as a message queue and processing data in
        background jobs. The kafka streams API aggregates the data on the cluster and stores
        the
        data an read optimised query service. I set up unit tests, integration tests and
        acceptance
        tests, all continuously deploying on Circle CI.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            WebSocket Chat API
        </b> -
        I built the Real time chat API at Unibuddy with web sockets scaling to thousands of
        concurrent users and persisting to MongoDB.

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            React Native App
        </b> -
        I lead development of the iOS and android React Native mobile app, including automated UI
        tests and continuous deployment with the fastlane tool.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            React Web Apps
        </b> -
        I was the primary frontend developer for the suite of React client apps at Unibuddy. This
        included the user management analytics dashboard and the main consumer facing web
        application. These were all built with react all connecting to the GraphQL API through the
        Apollo client.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Facebook Messenger Bot
        </b> -
        I also lead development of the conversational Facebook bot, connecting the Unibuddy chat API
        directly to the Messenger Platform.

        My <a href="https://www.gradehub.io">grade prediction calculator</a>,
        soared to success amongst students with over 65,000

        This <a href="https://freshers-calc.herokuapp.com">web app</a> developed for the <a

        and <a href="http://www.rbs.com">RBS</a>, used the latest web development technologies
        including ReactJS and Redux. This application was developed in a number of weeks using rapid
        prototyping and in heavy collaboration with the clients at the TAB. The end result was a
        great tool which could be embedded in a TAB article and shared with students all around the
        UK.

        Snaptale - Photo Sharing Social Network
    </h3>

    <img src="images/owlLogo1.png" alt="Thing Logo" height="150px"
         class="project-image-left rcorners">

    <p>Snaptale is an ios app and a social network which helps you find the best student events and
        night clubs.
        For my 4th year honours project, I implemented a newsfeed ordering algorithm inspired by
        Facebook’s EdgeRank and
        a recommender engine to predict future ‘Tales’ using Spark. In the same way that Netflix
        recommends movies,
        Snaptale is able to learn what Tales a user likes and push these to the top of their
        newsfeed.</p>

        ORBIT - Factset Online Report Builder Interface
    </h3>
    <p>My internship at Factset in London was to design a web interface in Angular JS, allowing non
        technical product
        developers to generate data reports. This replaced many steps in the development of all
        reports at Factset by
        highly automating the process. I also pioneered behaviour driven development in the company,
        providing a
        presentation and tutoring the engineers. They have since offered me a full time position as
        a Software
        Engineer.</p>

        Machine Learning Deep Neural Network
    </h3>
    <p>The aim of the project was to train multi-layer neural network classifiers and convolutional
        network classifiers
        to classify handwritten digits using the well- known MNIST dataset and Numpy. This was then
        written up as an
        iPython notebook. The project description can be found on the University of Edinburgh's
        <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/">course website</a>.</p>

        team project to
        design and implement a smart door lock for the IoT. The door can be remotely locked and
        unlocked via the smart phone apps, whilst still allowing the use of a physical key. You can
        enable your friends
        to lock and unlock your Smart Locks, all controlled through apps for iOS, Android and Web.
        Machine learning
        techniques are being used to classify malicious entries.</p>

    <p>This project is now being converted into a native iOS app.</p>

        Autonomous Robot Football
    </h3>
    <p>I led a team of 7, creating robots which played foosball autonomously against opposition
        robots using a planner
        and vision system connected to an overhead camera. The final tournament was attended by
        industry experts from
        Google, Amazon, IBM and Accenture.</p>
